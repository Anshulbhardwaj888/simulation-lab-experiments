Modelling is the process of representing a model which includes its construction and working. This model is similar to a real system, which helps the analyst predict the effect of changes to the system. In other words, modelling is creating a model which represents a system including their properties. It is an act of building a model.

Simulation of a system is the operation of a model in terms of time or space, which helps analyze the performance of an existing or a proposed system. In other words, simulation is the process of using a model to study the performance of a system. It is an act of using a model for simulation.
